# Cloudflare-my-ip
A script to update a DNS record with eithe rlocalhost or public internet facing IP address just like Afraid.org would provide.


Keeps your dynamic IP static by using a subdomain instead of your actual IP address when connecting to a IP:PORT you will use DOMAIN:PORT 


Just run this script on the machine with a dynamic IP and then use the domain name to connect in future
